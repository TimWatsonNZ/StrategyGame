Version .1 - World Creation 
          Implement camera controls, basic map generation.

All done.

Version .2  - Entity Update
                    - Goal is to be able to place entities into tiles and interact with them and for them to connect with each other.
                    - Implement entities in the world and the ability to create, edit, remove and give orders to entities.
                    - Implement connectivity of entities and being able to give move orders to these.
                    
            - Add some kind of soldier entity. - done
            - Add cities. - done
            - Add roads. - done
            - Road connection algorithm - for a given city find what it's connected to by roads. - done
            - City to city distance. - donerr
            - Moving entities - done
            - Buttons/keys to remove entities. - done
            - Button to remove entities. - done 
            - Redo road networks so that they are terminated by cities, this will speed up distance calculations. - done
            - Split off grid into another class and remove neighbour references in map entities - done
            - Prevent settlements from being too near each other. - done

Version .2.5         Refactor
          - Split off controls and entity adding from map to somewhere else. - done
          - Look at removing neighbours from Tiles/entities to reduce possibility of bugs. - done
          - Migrate to typescript - entities in particular could benefit from typing. - done

Version .3 - Resources/Economics update
                    - Goal is to get a basic pop, needs and resources system in place.
                    - Pops are divided by strata and also by job
                    - Pops desire and trade for goods locally.
                    - Some goods are take as tax.
                    - Access to goods will upgrade the area occupied by the pop.

            - refactor tile type to be an enum - done.
            - basic pop system - in progress
                    - pops gather resources - done
                    - pops require resources and consume them - done
                    - pops grow and shrink based on needs - done
                    - pops will improve their tile based on their resources and needs - done roughly
                    - pops need resources to do their job - in progress.
                    - pops send excess to the town area and also use this excess.  - in progress
                    - pops can become other kinds of pop.
                    - pops can migrate/move tile.

            - change demand/production calculations to be more aggregrate - do these in the city itself
                and then redistribute.
            - so then pops 'own' resources in a sort of aggregate...i think that will work.
            - move drawing logic into tiles. - done
            - cities own nearby tiles. - done
            - turn button. - done
            - implement crafter - in progress
            - resource flow to the city - food should end up in the city center, food should decay over time. - in progress
            - population growth based on food, find a way to grow but also limit growth. - kind of done?
           
Version .35 Refactor 
        - Keep collections of entities outside of tiles - maybe index these by tile id. In this way I can remove a lot of references
          from the tiles and I can selectively render them.
        - properly do tiles.
        - create drawable interface
        - create addable interface.
        - refactor pop update to make it more efficient - no need to check for things every tick.
        - make improvements nicer - very roughly done atm.
        - refactor tile - it's becoming ropey.
