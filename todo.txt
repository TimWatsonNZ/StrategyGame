Version .1 - World Creation 
          Implement camera controls, basic map generation.

All done.

Version .2  - Entity Update
                    - Goal is to be able to place entities into tiles and interact with them and for them to connect with each other.
                    - Implement entities in the world and the ability to create, edit, remove and give orders to entities.
                    - Implement connectivity of entities and being able to give move orders to these.
                    
            - Add some kind of soldier entity. - done
            - Add cities. - done
            - Add roads. - done
            - Road connection algorithm - for a given city find what it's connected to by roads. - done
            - City to city distance. - donerr
            - Moving entities - done
            - Buttons/keys to remove entities. - done
            - Button to remove entities. - done 
            - Redo road networks so that they are terminated by cities, this will speed up distance calculations. - done
            - Split off grid into another class and remove neighbour references in map entities - done
            - Prevent settlements from being too near each other. - done

Version .2.5         Refactor
          - Split off controls and entity adding from map to somewhere else. - done
          - Look at removing neighbours from Tiles/entities to reduce possibility of bugs. - done
          - Migrate to typescript - entities in particular could benefit from typing. - done

Version .3 - Resources/Economics update
                    - Goal is to get a basic pop, needs and resources system in place.
                    - Pops are divided by strata and also by job
                    - Pops desire and trade for goods locally.
                    - Some goods are take as tax.
                    - Access to goods will upgrade the area occupied by the pop.

            - refactor tile type to be an enum - done.
            - basic pop system - in progress
                    - pops gather resources - done
                    - pops require resources and consume them - done
                    - pops grow and shrink based on needs - done
                    - pops need resources to do their job - done.
                    - pops send excess to the town area and also use this excess. - done

            - change demand/production calculations to be more aggregrate - do these in the city itself
                and then redistribute.
            - so then pops 'own' resources in a sort of aggregate...i think that will work.
            - move drawing logic into tiles. - done
            - cities own nearby tiles. - done
            - turn button. - done
            - implement crafter - done
            - resource flow to the city - food should end up in the city center, food should decay over time. - in progress
            - population growth should be based on how satisfied needs are and on health of pop. - in progress.
            - implement trading of resources - in progress
            - perform transactions between pop groups. - in progress.
            - implement a form of taxation, doesn't need to be a large amount but just get the system working.
            - pops currently bottom out on goods that they want - they should still desire to buy things they need but have lots of.
            - goods can give bonuses to production - done
            - goods can give bonuses to health or fertility.
            - get a stable economy running.
           
Version .35 Mother of all Refactors
        - Remove all resource references by string, type data structures.
        - Keep collections of entities outside of tiles - maybe index these by tile id. In this way I can remove a lot of references
          from the tiles and I can selectively render them.
        - properly do tiles.
        - create drawable interface
        - create addable interface.
        - refactor pop update to make it more efficient - no need to check for things every tick.
        - make improvements nicer - very roughly done atm.
        - refactor tile - it's becoming ropey.
        - Perform some performance tests - I think we should be ok for performance but I'm concerned pop transactions might be slow.
        
Version .4 - Combat/Basic AI update
          - Goal is to be able to set destinations for units.
          - Create and destroy units.
          - Have units interact with each other
          - Have an antagonistic ai in place.
          - Be able to create own units based on population.
         
      - Crafter creates weapons?
      - Create and send out scouts.
      - Create barracks/soldier square
      - Entity movement and an A* algorithm to move things - control by key and by mouse.
      - basic combat system.
      - an enemy player.
      - hostile player who tries to defeat player.
      - Recruit from excess population.
      - Designate areas that pops can settle in.
      - Create a tax system here.
      - Fog of war.
      - can implement raiding here - if enemies are on a pop then the pop number and pop resources decreases.
      
Version .5 - Intercity update
          - Be able to settle new towns/settlements.
          - Be able to set up trade routes and markets.
          - Have a border displayed.
          - Expand on ai so they also found cities.
          - Introduce 'luxury' goods.
          
      - city to city population flow.
      - Remove roads and recalculate distances. - in progress
      - Remove roads and rebuild sub networks. - in progress
      - Trade between cities
      - Population flow between cities.
      - Creating new cities - settlers.
      
Version .6 - Map/Graphics update
          - Update map generation.
          - Use images for tiles/entities.
          - Add sound?
          - Improve UI

Add some buffers to the economy system - I'm concerned about feedback and instability. For example - pop grows too much and crashes, crash then affects other pops and whole economy collapses. Add buffers around pop growth and death in particular.
City walls.
Migrating pops
Basic diplomacy.
Attrition system.
Pop health system and crime that decreases pop number.
Loyalty system.
Some kind of influence/claim system.
More pops - stratas and more pop jobs.
          - pops can become other kinds of pop.
          - pops can migrate/move tile.
          - pops will improve their tile based on their resources and needs - done roughly
Add seasons and harvests.
Add different buildings like a granary.
Add government types.
Add raiding.
Improve pop system - add more pop kinds.
Add research.
Refactor out controls to somewhere else
